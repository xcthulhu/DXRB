This is an efficiency calculation for a proposed mission to measure the Diffuse X-Ray Background.  Here are some previous papers regarding this measurement, and the A4 catalogue which introduces systematic error in our calculation:

You can get an electronic version of the A4 catalog by going to the following page:

You will need to set "database_table" to "A4"

---------------------

eff.py models a sun-spinner, spinning around once a day
It prints a tab seperated table of half-angle versus %non-contamination over the course of a year.

The algorithm works as follows:

<pseudocode>
Given a half-angle tau, we loop through every day for a year (or some other timestep given by the variable stepsize), starting with midnight 1/1/1971.

	- Every day (denoted by the variable t), we use pyephem to 
	  calculate the position of the sun as a vector on the unit sphere 
	  around the earth (this is sv(t)).  

	  We then loop through every angle theta in [0,2pi], using some small 
	  increment (this is set by pv_res)

		- For every angle theta, a unit-sphere pointing vector 
		  orthogonal to the sun vector is obtained (this is pv_),
		  using the following:

		  b3 = sv(t) x [0,0,1]
		  pv_ = sv(t) * cos(theta) + b3 * sin(theta)
  
		  We then loop a vector xv through a list of vectors 
		  representing the A4 catalogue + GRS1915

			- If there is some source xv such that 
			  xv.pv_ > cos(tau), then the scan 
			  for that angle at that day was contaminated, 
			  because a source was within a half-angle of 
			  where we were looking.  If not then we increment 
			  the variable "clear"

	- After all that nested looping, we calculate
 
				  clear
		rho =   ------------------------------
			pv_res*(365*24*60*60/stepsize)
	  
	  If this is 1, then we were never contaminated in the entire loop.  
	  If it's 0 then there was always a source seen by our detector.

	  The last step is to print tau and rho

</pseudocode>

This is the routine used to generate the table in angles.dat
